          <h2>With the success of Nirvana, grunge music was starting to influence all mainstream platforms by the early 1990s. Courtney Love, a notorious rock scenester in the 80s, and her ex-boyfriend Erik Erlandson took this new Gen-X wave of music as their opportunity to start a band and become rock stars themselves. Already heavily in the world of grunge music, they found it easy to find their sound and record their first album, Pretty on the Inside.</h2>
            <h3>Courtney supported the band early on by stripping, which also served as inspiration for some of the album’s content.</h3>
          <h2>Hole created a grunge sound that was raw and angry, but maintained the sadness and rhythm that the genre would become known for. Love’s agression during recording forced everyone in the band to split—except Erlandson. Despite this, the album was an underground success.</h2>

          <h2>When Courtney met Kurt Cobain, the lead singer of Nirvana, they got on like “a house on fire,” according to Love. They both came from broken families and wanted to pusue their own family to makae up for that fact, they were also both deeply addicted to heroin.</h2>
            <h3>Kurt and Courtney were married on February 24, 1992 in Hawaii; Love was 2 months pregnant at the time, and both were still using heroin regularly.</h3>
          <h2>The couple was crowned the king and queen of grunge music, but the verdict was still out as to if their romance would cause the destructions of their bands, like John and Yoko, or the destructions of each other, like Sid and Nancy. Their daughter, Frances Bean, was born the summer after their marriage; finally bringing the couple their longed for family; but, their drug use was spiraling out of control.</h2>

The situation led to anger from Cobain and Love who began to try and change the topic of discussion from their drug use to their music.</h2>
