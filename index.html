          <h2>With the success of Nirvana, grunge music was starting to influence all mainstream platforms by the early 1990s. Courtney Love, a notorious rock scenester in the 80s, and her ex-boyfriend Erik Erlandson took this new Gen-X wave of music as their opportunity to start a band and become rock stars themselves. Already heavily in the world of grunge music, they found it easy to find their sound and record their first album, Pretty on the Inside.</h2>
            <h3>Courtney supported the band early on by stripping, which also served as inspiration for some of the album’s content.</h3>
          <h2>Hole created a grunge sound that was raw and angry, but maintained the sadness and rhythm that the genre would become known for. Love’s agression during recording forced everyone in the band to split—except Erlandson. Despite this, the album was an underground success.</h2>

            <h3>Kurt and Courtney were married on February 24, 1992 in Hawaii; Love was 2 months pregnant at the time, and both were still using heroin regularly.</h3>
          <h2>The couple was crowned the king and queen of grunge music, but the verdict was still out as to if their romance would cause the destructions of their bands, like John and Yoko, or the destructions of each other, like Sid and Nancy. Their daughter, Frances Bean, was born the summer after their marriage; finally bringing the couple their longed for family; but, their drug use was spiraling out of control.</h2>

The situation led to anger from Cobain and Love who began to try and change the topic of discussion from their drug use to their music.</h2>
            <h3>Hole began developing their second album. It would be a continuation of Love’s interest in vanity and  motherhood.</h3>
          <h2>Nirvana released their follow-up to Nevermind, In Utero, just as Hole started making their follow-up album. In Utero was a major success, but dealt with many of the same topics as Love was developing for Hole’s album; this similarity in tone and melody would spark rumors that Kurt was ghostwriting for his wife.</h2>

While Courtney had lessened her heroin usage, Kurt had become a full-out junkie and his shame and depression was growing larger.</h2>
            <h3>Cobain overdosed on pills after a concert in Rome, putting him in a temporary coma. This event also put him in rehab.</h3>
          <h2>Unable to persuade Kurt to slow down on the drugs, Courtney called for an intervention; but, the situation only further isolated Kurt from those around him as he began to abuse the drug further. Courtney, who was still using drugs herself, began to feel the stress of the situation and started lashing out at Kurt and those around her. She turned to her upcoming album to distract her.</h2>

            <h3>Kurt Cobain killed himself on April 5, 1994 with a shotgun after taking a lethal dose of heroin.</h3>
          <h2>The members of Nirvana and Kurt’s friends gathered together to morn that day, but Love went on a days long drug-binge instead. In a haze, she made very public appearances to read Kurt’s suicide note and to give away some of his clothes to fans. This strange behavior, as well as a few inconsistencies with Kurt’s note, led to a rumor that still follows Love—that she had Kurt killed, and forged the note in order to serve as her alibi.</h2>

Despite the fact that Love was unable to promote the record during this time, it wasa  big commercial and critical success. Rolling Stone Magazine even declared it “Album of the Year.” The track list inluded:</h2>

          <h2>Live Through This was a much more polished and melodic record, but with the passion and anger of Pretty on the Inside. Singles such as “Miss World” and “Asking For It” dealt with Love’s obsession with beauty and her poor public perception; whereas, “Doll Parts” and “Softer, Softest” tackle issues of Love’s relationship with Kurt and motherhood. To many, it is the last great grunge record.</h2>

Along wiht those who enjoyed the music, some in the crowd of thousdands booed Love and held signs in the memory of Kurt Cobain.</h2>

The album would have a much more pop-punk sound and deal with the loss of Love’s husband, her breakup with Ed Norton, and the alienation she felt as an outsider in the movie business.</h2>
            <h3>The album was a critical and commercial success, but Hole had traded in its raw and angry sound for a more sad tone.</h3>
          <h2>Courtney was maintaining her sobriety, but that was much harder to do in the circle of rock musicians she had rejoined. Celebrity Skin also casued some controversy after Billy Corgan, lead singer of the Smashing Pumpkins and one of Love’s exes, claimed to have co-written much of the album; Love denied these claims, giving Corgan only partial credit for the title song. Despite their success, the other memeber of Hole were finding it much harder this tour to live in the shadow of Courtney Love’s celebrity.</h2>

Love took the breakup of her band as a chance to begin a solo career in music, but it would prove harder than she though. After years sober, Love relaspsed and started on a downward spiral.</h2>

In 2009 Courtney was forced to give primary custody of daughter Frances Bean to Kurt’s mother and sister. In 2010, Courtney attempted to revive Hole, with entirely different memebers, witht he album Nobody’s Daughter—which also flopped. As of 2017, Courtney Love has sobered up again and reconciled with those she alienated durign the past 20 years; she has not released any music in nearly a decade.</h2>
